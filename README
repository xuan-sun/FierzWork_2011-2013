Starting a directory to do Fierz-only analysis.

Update on what we have.

blindingMCFiles.cc will create blinded MC files to be used instead of b=0.
This only needs to be done once.

createBGTrees.cc will make the background model trees.
This only needs to be done once.

comparehist.cc is what we run to get the Fierz fit using TFractionFitter.
This is done every time we want to redo the fit.

energyRelationsForBrad.cc was getting an Erecon vs primKE plot for Brad.
It's not used for anything useful.

histfitter.cc - I can't figure out why this is here. I don't think we use it.
It looks like it was the model for comparehist.cc so we don't need it.
Checking Github, it looks like histfitter was used with master_histfitter.
So we could do bulk replacements using bash scripting.
Hence it's not useful for the Fierz work we are doing right now.

plotChisquared.cc reads in a .txt file and plots the chi squared values. Simple.
Needs to be run every time we do an overall new comparehist.cc.

plotFierz.cc reads in a .txt file and plots fierz values. Simple.
Needs to be run every time we do an overall new comparehist.cc

PrintTreesToPDF.C is a ROOT script used to look at the octet energy spectra.

shapeFactor.cc is a big deal. It reads in MC files and creates shape factors.
It also redoes the fit and makes a new chi-squared measurement (independent of TFractionFitter).

ssDataHist.cc creates super summed rates for octets of data.
ssMCHist.cc creates super summed counts for MC octets.
Both only need to be run once to create "base" MC files.

viewRuns.cc is used to print all the runs that go into one octet, and the background, to pdf.
Was only useful in debugging.

In order to "re-run" for new results, here's the order:

0. Make sure you have the right histograms from ssDataHist.cc and ssMCHist.cc/blindingMCFiles.cc.

1. Run newXuanFitter.cc to get the TMinuit fit results.

2. Run shapeFactor.cc to plot shape factors for TMinuit Fit, and TH1::Fit().
This will also spit out chisquared values for the two shape factors plus the chisquared of the TMinuit fit.

3. Run plotPostShapeFactor.cc to plot the Fierz values or chisquared values.

In order to extract a full new set of blinded b values for energy spectra and asymmetry, we run

1. blinded_postMBProcessed_asymm.cc - this gets you the blinded asymmetry value.

2. newXuanFitter.cc - this gets you a set of fit values to the blinded MC spectra.

3. shapeFactor.cc - extracts a shape factor from the data and runs additional fits. 
It fits the shape factor to a formula for another b value. It also plots a shape factor
using the fit value from newXuanFitter for comparison. Lastly, it calculates a chi-squared
for both the newXuanFitter shape factor and the fitted shape factor.

4. plotPostShapeFactor.cc - creates plots with legends that are helpful of the b values and chi squares.
