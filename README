Starting a directory to do Fierz-only analysis.


November 29, 2017

Update on what we have.

blindingMCFiles.cc will create blinded MC files to be used instead of b=0.
This only needs to be done once.

createBGTrees.cc will make the background model trees.
This only needs to be done once.

comparehist.cc is what we run to get the Fierz fit using TFractionFitter.
This is done every time we want to redo the fit.

energyRelationsForBrad.cc was getting an Erecon vs primKE plot for Brad.
It's not used for anything useful.

histfitter.cc - I can't figure out why this is here. I don't think we use it.
It looks like it was the model for comparehist.cc so we don't need it.
Checking Github, it looks like histfitter was used with master_histfitter.
So we could do bulk replacements using bash scripting.
Hence it's not useful for the Fierz work we are doing right now.

plotChisquared.cc reads in a .txt file and plots the chi squared values. Simple.
Needs to be run every time we do an overall new comparehist.cc.

plotFierz.cc reads in a .txt file and plots fierz values. Simple.
Needs to be run every time we do an overall new comparehist.cc

PrintTreesToPDF.C is a ROOT script used to look at the octet energy spectra.

shapeFactor.cc is a big deal. It reads in MC files and creates shape factors.
It also redoes the fit and makes a new chi-squared measurement (independent of TFractionFitter).

ssDataHist.cc creates super summed rates for octets of data.
ssMCHist.cc creates super summed counts for MC octets.
Both only need to be run once to create "base" MC files.

viewRuns.cc is used to print all the runs that go into one octet, and the background, to pdf.
Was only useful in debugging.
