This directory is made to rerun the endpoint corrections and refit the super sum data.

Especially now that we have optimized the fit window over in Expanded_Error_Bar_StatSyst/

In order to do this:
1. Rerun endpoint fits (on histograms) and save the endpoints of each octet of the new optimized fit windows.
2. View the mean value of these endpoint fits to set the new endpoint correction.
3. Scale the energies with the new endpoint corrections.
4. Run ssDataHist_radialCut.cc to get radial cuts (and type, side, pid, etc) into histograms.
5. Create integrated dataset.
6. Run newXuanFitter.cc from somewhere and fit the new integrated datasets with baseline Monte Carlo's for SS b fits.
