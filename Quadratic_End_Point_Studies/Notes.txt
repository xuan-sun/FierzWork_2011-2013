After applying these energy corrections, which is all done in this directory, I go to PositionCuts/

There I run ssDataHist_radialCuts.cc to do the position cutting and make a histogram of each octet.
The fit is then done, in PositionCuts/, using newXuanFitter_positionCuts.cc.

The final results are saved as .txt files in PositionCuts/, copied over here.

The graphs (saved here) are made with viewValuesVsOctets.cc in PositionCuts/, that is not copied over here.
